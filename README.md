This is a starter project to use in F# coding dojos.

It just embeds FAKE, Paket, and references to NUnit, as well as @sforkmann's lightweight FsUnit.fs file.

Just clone the repo or download it, and get started coding and testing in F#!

To get started, just run build.cmd or ./build.sh in the folder. The first build should fail, as one of the 2 tests is a failing one. You're first task could be to fix it :)
